      #Story
      
      You take the role of Max, a kid on a quest to save a missing child. The underground has finally seen the sunlight, but the sense of freedom is not there.

      Trapped in a ravine due to the after effects of a genocide run, the MONSTERS have made a new home in the Otherground, a counterpart to the Underground. Anyone can enter, but no one can leave.

      Not until the seventh HUMAN soul is claimed. MONSTERS, however, have grown to love their new home. But yet, there are still the ones desperate for true freedom.
